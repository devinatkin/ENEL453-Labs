\subsection{Marking}
Lab 1 will be pass/ fail. So long as everything is submitted on time and works according to the required modifications you will receive 100\%. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Include all the required files for your design and test benches. This means that all the System Verilog Files are present even if they are unmodified. Also be sure to include the associated constraints file.
    \item Remember to adjust both the CRC being calculated and the Reset polarity for both the sub-modules and the associated test benches. 
    \item Include a design report file. This should include your timing constraints and a calculation of the maximum operating frequency for your design. It also needs to include a screenshot of your RTL view after making the modifications. Your report should have a cover page containing your Name, Student ID, Lab Section, and Lab Title. 
    \item \textit{While no waveform drawings are required for this lab, be aware that they will be part Lab 2, 3, and 4}. 
\end{itemize}

Each of the changes required will be verified against a randomized set of input data.\\
