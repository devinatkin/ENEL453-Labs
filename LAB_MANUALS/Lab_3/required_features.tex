This is a check list for all of the design feature requirements. Ensure that each of these features is demonstrable within an associated test bench. This list does not include best practices features such as including a reset in synchronous logic; however, that is still a design requirement. \\
% {\large Timer Features}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The 7 Segment Display should show the current time.
%     \item Buttons should be used to control minute increment, minute decrement, reset, and start/stop functionality
%     \item The 7 Segment display should show the current time on the timer both when the timer is running and when it is paused.
%     \item The 7 Segment display should blink when the timer runs out. 
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{Stop Watch Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The 7 Segment Display should show the current time.
    \item Buttons should be used to control the Start/Stop and Reset functions of the stop watch. 
    \item Time should be displayed in minutes and seconds on the 7 segment display. 
\end{itemize}
