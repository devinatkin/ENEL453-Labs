Every good design needs a diagram. This can be in the form of timing diagrams, block diagrams, class diagrams. Never over estimate your own ability to forget what you were doing or how you were approaching a design. Even with small designs I'm constantly scribbling on pieces of paper to straighten out exactly what I'm looking to implement. 

Many great tools exist for creating design diagrams, and you're welcome to use any of them for completing your design; however, I'll point you towards Mermaid Diagramming Markdown language as a great option for building powerful diagrams. 

While we cannot cover all the details of the setup. Here's an example diagram illustrating the functionality of a simple PWM module like the one provided in LAB 2.
\begin{verbatim}
    graph TB
    CNT["Counter 8-bits"]
    PWM["PWM Output"]
    CLK["CLK_IN"]
    DUT["DUTY"]
    MAX["MAX VALUE"]
    LESS([<])
    GRT([>])
  
        CLK -- "Increment" --> CNT
        CNT -->LESS
        DUT --->LESS
        LESS -->PWM
        MAX --->GRT
        CNT--> GRT
        GRT --"RESET"--> CNT
\end{verbatim}

The above code produces the following diagram:

    \includegraphics[width = 9cm]{Images/ProvidedPWM/PWM_block_diagram.png}

\end{figure}

If you would prefer to avoid hand drawing diagrams I recommend giving this system a try. It is freely available online at \url{https://mermaid.js.org/} and can be accessed without signing up. The provided design has been diagrammed below alongside the code.

I will note that this diagram is not perfect. It leaves out some of the finer details, like the active high versus active low reset, and duplicate instantiating of modules such as the debounce module. However, it shows sufficient details that if I am returning to this design in the future I will be able to work with and update the design appropriately without needing to read large portions of the document.
