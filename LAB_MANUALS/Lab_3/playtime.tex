You've create a nice little design for a simple stop watch set of functionality. With extensive verification this is a reasonable use case where a design like yours would find a real world application as an ASIC. You likely wouldn't find an FPGA inside a production device due to the costs; however, so long as sufficient quantities were required a custom fabricated ASIC can help eliminate costs and save power. \\

I'd encourage you to expand upon your design here. Add additional functionality to the existing design. Digilent the creator of the Basys 3 board provides an IP block which can be used to connect the Basys 3 up to a keybaord through a simple control. Allow the values to be set via the keyboard input. Create a game based around timing.
