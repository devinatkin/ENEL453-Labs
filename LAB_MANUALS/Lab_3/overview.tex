In lab 2 you made pretty lights dance on the Basys 3 board. In this lab you have to create a multi-function device which can act as a stop watch, and timer. You are going to be provided with a validated timer design to act as a starting point for your design. You need to implement the logic for the Stop Watch and modify the provided design to implement both the Stop Watch and Timer simultaneously using a switch to go between modes.\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item In Timer mode the timer can be set in minutes and seconds with both increment and decrement modes. When the timer hits zero the output blinks at roughly a one hertz pulse. 
    \item The Stop watch mode which you need to implement should allow the stop watch to be started, stopped, and reset. The stop watch should run up to at least 59 minutes and 59 seconds.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{All of these functionalities must be demonstrated separately for the submitted test benches; however, they should work together as well. \\}
