The first two labs were simple enough that a full timing report will have been mostly a formality. However, in labs 3 and 4 there is a significant chance that you will run into issues with the timing of your design and will need to improve it to pass. Please review the Lab 1 instructions on how to calculate your maximum clock speed to confirm that you are meeting timing spec. Remember your design must function at the system clock speed of 100MHz to pass.
