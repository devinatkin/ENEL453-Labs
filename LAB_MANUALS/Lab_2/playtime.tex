Learning through play is generally agreed to be the best approach to learning regardless of your age. To help you prepare for your midterm I suggest writing additional HDL code. In this lab you created a fun pattern on the LED output of the Basys 3. To go further add an option to change the direction of the wave by pressing a button, or disable the LED's by flipping a switch. If you do this, you will be able to potentially reuse this module in Lab 3 or 4 to make your design more visually impressive.
