In lab 1 you modified a provided CRC calculator to calculate a different CRC than it was initially designed for, in this lab you will be provided with a basic Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) module alongside a top module which instantiates a single PWM. You will be asked to modify it in such a way as to produce a wave effect where the lights cycle in brightness in a standard pattern. To do this you will need to create a clock divider and a simple state machine to control the light levels.\\

We'll walk you through creating this step by step, but I encourage you to think about each step independently and what the hardware is doing. While the guide here will show you how to create a wave, other patterns are acceptable and I encourage you to have some fun.
