Silicon used to be incredibly difficult to manufacture; however, recently great progress has been made towards open sourcing the tools used for producing chip designs. We highly recommend that any students interested in pursuing chip design investigate \url{https://tinytapeout.com/}. They are a group doing open source tape out designs on the Sky 130nm process. Your designs from this lab can be effectively translated into a custom piece of silicon on the next tiny tape out run.
