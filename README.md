#ENEL 453 Lab Documents
Lab Docs is a submodule containing the documents in an overleaf git

Lab 1 Focusses on CRC Checks
- Student files will implement a basic parity bit and they will be walked through improving it.
- Full Testbench will be provided to verify both the original CRC and confirm when they have moved to the new one.
- Submitted work can be simply auto-graded using a basic verilog simulator

Lab 2 Focusses on PWM 
- Student files will implement a 1 second period, 1-bit PWM and they will be asked to improve it, increasing the speed and bit count.
- A testbench will be provided which prints basic information about the PWM signal so that they can confirm it works. 
- Submitted work can be simply auto-graded with a complete verilog testbench and simulator, Llama 2 running locally can confirm the testbench functionality

Lab 3 Create a Countdown Timer and Stop Watch Functionaltiy
- Students will be provided with a DoubleDabble module and Debounce module, and instructed to implement the count down timer with start, and stop functionality.
- Counting down from 10 minutes in 1 second intervals. Stopping at 0 until it has been reset
- So long as student testbenches contain display statements illustrating the functionaltiy this section may be able to be auto-graded using Llama 2 or using a standardized output file format. 

Lab 4 Create a Reaction Time Game 
- Students will not be provided with any additional code, they will be instructed to implement a reaction time game using the code used in the previous labs as a starting point.
- The game should after a preset amount of time flash the display and then show the time between the flash and the button press
- So long as the student testbenches contain display statements illustrating the functionality this section may be able to be auto-graded using Llama 2 or using a standardized output file format.
